The code downloads the fashion_mnist dataset and plots one image from each of the ten classes (Q1).

The code implements the feed forward propagation and gives the output as the probabilities of the images for each class. 

The program is flexible to vary the no.of hidden layers and size of each hidden layer.

The code implements the backpropagation algorithm along with Optimisation functions - stochastic gradient descent, momentum based gradient descent, nesterov accelerated gradient descent, rmsprop, adam, nadam.Batch_size is flexible in the code.

The program has algorithm to run wandb sweeps.

Confusion matrix is also plotted.
